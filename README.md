# rest-api-practice

A repo to practise latest REST api methods.

A  virtual env is recommended. Install dependencies using requirements.txt for backend, and npm install after going in Frontend/ folder.
Run `python manage.py runserver` in the root folder to start the backend, and run `npm start` in Frontend/Frontend folder after running `npm install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the correct directories.

Tasks left to be done:

-> Integrate more databases(Postgres,Mongodb,mysql)

-> Integrate Better JWT authorization

-> Add and use React redux

-> Add comments

-> Add button for defining in todos app to practise using 3rd party apis

-> Add login/register and permission based classes

-> Improve css of frontend

-> Delete redundant code (non-operational attempts and console logs)

-> Bundle the project better or create script to run backend and frontend with the same command

-> Improve/change names of apps

-> Much, Much more !!
